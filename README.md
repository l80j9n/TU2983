TU2983: Advanced Databases
Individual Assignment   1
Normalized   Relational Databases and   Basic System   Interfaces
TASK   1:   Build a   Normalized   Relational Database   in Microsoft Access for your   individually assigned   topic:
1.             Refer to the   “TU2983   Individual Assignment Topics”   document   on   http://ukmfolio.ukm.my for   your   individually   assigned   topic.   Decide on   an appropriate/catchy   name   for a shop   selling this   product   (e.g   “Solar   Panel   Mart”).
2.             Build   a table   called TBL_PRODUCTS_   (e.g. TBL_PRODUCTS_A123456) that   contains   a   minimum   of   40   rows   of   products   matching your   individually assigned topic.    This table   must   have the following   attributes:
●             FLD_PRODUCT_ID      assign your   own   ID   (keep   it simple,   future   assignments   will   be   based   on   the   same   data)
●             FLD_PRODUCT_NAME      copy from the source website   (e.g.   amazon.com,   tesco.com, zalora.com)
●             FLD_PRICE      copy from the source website,   or set   your   own   price.
●             2 other attributes   that   can   be   used   as   categories   (e.g   FLD_BRAND,   FLD_TYPE,   FLD_SHIRTSIZE)
●             At   least another   2 attributes   of   any type (e.g. FLD_DESCRIPTION,   FLD_QUANTITY,   FLD_WARRANTYLENGTH)   Your TBL_PRODUCTS_ table   must   have   at   least   7 attributes   in total.
3.             Copy   a   picture   of the   product, for   each   product   in your TBL_PRODUCTS_ table,   and   rename   the   picture   to   match   your   FLD_PRODUCT_ID for the   product.    (e.g.   if the   FLD_PRODUCT_ID is   “25”, save the   picture as   “25.jpg”)
●             Save   all you   pictures   in   a   subfolder   called   “pictures”   .
4.               Build additional tables for   the following:
●             1 table for   Staff   information,   with   the   necessary   attributes   (start   with   only   3   staff)
●             1 table for   Customer   information,   with   the   necessary   attributes   (start   with   only   3   customers)
●             1 table for   Order   information,   with   the   necessary   attributes   (start with   no   orders)
●             And any additional   table you   need   so that:
o      1   customer can   make   many orders,   but each order   is only for   1   customer
o      1   order can contain   many   products,   and each   product can   be   in   many   orders
o      1 staff can   process   many   orders,   but each   order is   only   processed   by   1   staff
●             Ensure that   all your tables   are   normalized to   at   least   3NF.
5.             Use the   relationship   view   in   Microsoft   Access   to   specify the   relationship   between   each   o代 写TU2983: Advanced Databases  Individual Assignment 1

●               Each table   must   be   related to   at   least   1 other table.
●             All tables   must   be connected to   each other through   relationships.
●             Enforce referential   integrity   on   all   your   relationships to   show the   cardinality   of   the   relationship   in   the   Microsoft   Access   Relationship View.
6.             Your database file   must   be   saved as   DB__.accdb   (e.g.   DB_SOLARPANELMART_A123456.accdb)
TASK 2:   Build a   new Visual   Basic   .NET   project for   creating a   Basic System   Interface for your   shop:
1.             Build   a   “Main   Menu” for your   shop,   called   frm_mainmenu_.vb   (e.g.   frm_mainmenu_a123456.vb)
●             Your “Main   Menu”   must   have   buttons, where   each   button will   open   a   separate form. that   can   view   the   contents   of   one   table.   You   must   have enough   buttons and forms to open and view the contents   of   all   your tables.
●                For   each table   (products, customers, staff, orders)   build   a form. that   will   open   and   view the   table’sdata.
●             Each   button   on   your   “Main   Menu”   must   open   one   of these forms.      You   must   have   at   least   4   buttons.
●             Your “Main   Menu” will   be evaluated   in   terms   of   aesthetics,   design,   neatness   and   professionalism.
2.             Your VB.   NET   project   must   be   saved as   prj__   (e.g.   prj_solarpanelmart_a123456)
SUBMIT THE   FOLLOWING:
1.             Your entire VB project folder   for this   assignment’s   project.
2.             Your   Microsoft Access Database, which   should   be   stored   in   your VB   project’s   Bin/Debug   directory.
3.             Your “pictures”   subfolder, which   should   be   stored   as   a   subdirectory   in   your VB   project’s   Bin/Debug   directory.
●             Compress   all the files above   into a   single   *.ZIP   or   *.   RAR,   and   label   this   file   as   _●             ***   IMPORTANT   ***: Your   *.ZIP/*.RAR must   not   exceed   100mb   (Megabytes).      If   it   does   exceed   100mb,   you   need   to   reduce   the   resolution of all your   pictures, in order to   reduce their file   size.
●             Upload your   *.ZIP/*.   RAR file to   UKMfolio,   at   the   Lab   Assignment   1 Submission   Link   which   has   your   EVALUATOR’S   NAME   on   it.
●             All   *.ZIP/*.RAR files for the assignment   must   be submitted to   UKMfolio   before   the   following   due   date:
Due   date: Sunday 8th    December 2024,   11:59pm   Malaysia Time (GMT +8).
